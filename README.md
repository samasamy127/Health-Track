# ü©∫ Health Track

## üß† Problem Description

Maintaining and monitoring health parameters is vital for a healthy lifestyle, yet most individuals rely on manual tracking or scattered data, making it difficult to detect trends or issues. Common problems include:

* No centralized log for health data
* Difficulty identifying abnormal health metrics
* Lack of alerts for health risks
* Poor visualization of progress or health trends

**Health Track** addresses these issues by providing a complete tool for health monitoring. Users can input health data such as weight, height, blood pressure, and heart rate either manually or via file upload. The program then:

* Calculates BMI, averages, and trends
* Categorizes results (e.g., underweight, elevated BP)
* Issues warnings for abnormal values
* Generates a comprehensive health report

## üë• Team Contribution

### **Sama Samy**

Developed the following functions:

1. `bmi_calculate()`: Computes BMI using `BMI = weight / (height^2)`
2. `categorize_bmi()`: Classifies BMI as *underweight*, *normal*, *overweight*, or *obese*
3. `average_value()`: Calculates the weekly average for each health metric
4. `find_maximum()`: Finds the highest value among the metrics
5. `find_minimum()`: Finds the lowest value among the metrics
6. `calculate_bp_category()`: Categorizes blood pressure as *normal*, *elevated*, or *hypertension*
7. `collect_data_from_user()`: Collects data manually from the user

‚úÖ Integrated BMI and BP classification into the main workflow.

### **Nouran Fares**

Developed the following functionalities:

1. `read_data()`: Reads user data from a file
2. `write_data()`: Writes processed data and health metrics to an output file
3. `check_health_warning()`: Detects and reports abnormal metrics
4. `validate_input()`: Validates user inputs for correctness
5. `export_full_report()`: Generates a detailed health report with all metrics and warnings
6. `collect_data_from_file()`: Collects data from user-specified file

‚úÖ Integrated all functions into the `main()` function, ensuring correct execution flow.
